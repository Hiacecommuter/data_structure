advantage:
insertion and delete at interior of arr is fast

Single linked list
- The linked list instance must keep a reference to the first node of list, known as the head.
- Linking hopping / pointer hopping: move from one node to its next
- Use a reference to tail for fast adding

Circularly linked list
- advance the tail reference to point the node that follows it

Doubly linked list
